# creativeChatbot
The research groupe seven of the Weizenbaum Institute is working on a research project that has the aim to create a chatbot, that helps people to be more creative at work.

What already know or what we have already done
- we have an idea about how that chatbot should work in order to help people to be more creative
- we know that we need our own training data in order to have a chatbot that works for our purpose correctly
- we are using the python module chatterbot to create our chatbot

What we need to do next
- we need to get to know how that structure of the traning data has to be in order to feed our bot with this data
- we need to simulate creative conversations in order to create our own training data
